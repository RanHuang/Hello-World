Using the Skeleton:
1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename(move) the NAME module to be the name of your project or whaterver you want to call your root module.
3. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.
4. Reanm tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.
5. Double check is's all working by using nosetests again.
6. Start coding.

e.g:
1. Copy skeleton to ex47
2. Rename everything with NAME to ex47
3. Change the word NAME in all the files to ex47
4. Finally, remove all the *.pyc files to make sure you're clean

Testing guidelines:
1. Test files go in tests/ and are named BLAH_tests.py; otherwise nosetests won't run them. This also keeps your tests from clashing with your other code.
2. Write one test file for each module you make.
3. Keep your test cases(functions)short, but do not worry if they are a bit messy. Test cases are usually kind of messy.
4. Create helper functions that get rid of duplicate code.
5. Finally, do not get too attached to your tests. Sometimes, the best way to redesign something is to just delete it and start over.
